 Acceptance criteria are the “conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user,
 customer or other stakeholders.
 Most teams lean towards two specific types: rule-oriented or scenario-oriented.
 Rule-oriented requirements are straight-forward. They list out observable outcomes.
 “Display statement balance upon successful authentication.”
 On the other hand, scenario-oriented criteria tend to follow the “Given…When…Then…” template.

 Benefits of using acceptance criteria;
 get the team to think through how a feature or piece of functionality will work from the user’s perspective
 remove ambiguity from requirements
 form the tests that will confirm that a feature or piece of functionality is working and complete.
